      Dear Ellaine,<br /><br />
      Salamat sa tanan. For the love, the laughter, and the memories I will carry with me forever. Thank you for choosing to spend time with me, for giving me a part of your world, and for letting me love you in the best way I knew how. You showed me a love so pure, one that made me feel safe, seen, and deeply cared for. Kabalo ka kung naa koy sakit bisan wala pa ko moingon, and you always worried about me. You cared not just for me but for my familyâ€”even for Mama. That meant more than I could ever put into words.

Thank you for showing me every side of youâ€”the real, unfiltered, ikaw na ikaw. You were comfortable with me, and knowing that made me the happiest. You let me in, and that alone is something I will always treasure.

I am so lucky that you were my first in so many thingsâ€”my first love, my first real taste of what it means to love someone so much that the world feels both too big and too small at the same time. My life changed the moment you walked into it, and I wouldnâ€™t trade that for anything.

I made this website for you, thinking my first website would be my portfolio, pero diri ko na una. I just wanted to make something that could lastâ€”something you can always visit whenever you miss me. I'll keep it alive for as long as I can, and I hope, even just once in a while, you'll check it too.

If ever naa kay problema, kung masakit ka, or even if you just need someone on your sideâ€”Iâ€™m here. Always. I want to follow your advice and find someone to talk to, pero lisod para nako. I want so badly to open up, especially after everything that happened to us, but I just keep it all inside.

I wish I had danced with you more instead of just pretending while you took videos. I wish I had savored every moment a little longer, held on just a little tighter, loved you just a little louder. You deserved to be the happiest youâ€™ve ever been, and all I ever wanted was to make you feel safe, loved, and comforted. Gusto ra gyud nako nga kabalo ka nga pwede ka moanhi nako anytimeâ€”kung dili ka okay, kung puno imong mata ug luhaâ€”I would hold you until you felt okay again.

You were my first love, my greatest love, and my hardest lesson. If my absence brings you peace, then I will give that to you. Pero please, please knowâ€”I am always here, whenever you need me. I donâ€™t regret loving you, not for a second. I gave you pieces of myself willingly, and I would do it all over again if it meant I got to love you one more time.

Iâ€™m sorry if I held on too long, even when you had already asked me to let go. I stayed because loving you was the only thing I truly knew how to do. Iâ€™m sorry if I ever hurt you, if I ever made things harder, if I ever took too long to understand things. Kahibalo nako sa unsay padulngan ani, but before it does, I just wanted to spend a little more time with youâ€”even if just in this moment, in these words.

What we had was real. What we made was beautiful. No matter how painful it is now, I wouldnâ€™t change a thing. You say you canâ€™t hate me, and I could never, ever hate you either.

I love you, my EC. ðŸŒ¸ðŸ©· Until we meet againâ€”when weâ€™re both the best versions of ourselves.

I miss you. I miss us. Naay kakulangan kung wala ka.<br /><br />
      Yours truly,<br />
      Nas
